This repository contains the chess program created by a team of seven as a project for the EECS 22L class at UCI. Project was version controlled using CVS and has been moved here for easier access and backup.

The project is fully functioning other than the "Hard" AI. 

The program was initially compiled and ran on `CentOS 6.9 (Final)` using `gcc 4.4.7 2013313`.

To compile the project, run `make all`.
